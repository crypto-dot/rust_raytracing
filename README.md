# rust_raytracing
Recreating a c++ raytracer in rust

## Goal
A while back I had started creating a C++ raytracer (never completed). I decided to at least try to remake it in Rust (to learn more about it), while using some AI technology for help (mainly copilot and a bit of GPT). A lot has changed since I first started programming, so the goal will be to at least get a fully functional ray tracer and add some more features on top of it.
